## 👋 Hello there!
My name is Andreas but most people just call me Andre.  
On the internet am I known as either Andre_601 or Andre601.

I'm a Hobby Developer who develops stuff in my free time (which is a lot right now) in Java. My most popular/well known project so far is [\*Purr\*][purr], a Discord Bot that reached over 50,000 Servers (And still counting).

If you have any questions, feel free to join my [personal Discord Server][discord]. I'm pretty much always around and have time to answer stuff.

## 📁 Projects
Below this Readme can you find a list of Projects that I believe are my most popular ones (Or those you might be most interested in).
